For details on how an elasticsearch watcher works - https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/watcher-ui.html

The watcher code shows how you can integrate a webhook action of Elasticsearch to a watcher. Here the webhook refers to a OTRS endpoint for creating tickets. Check the waebhook body and change the needful like ip, username and password accordingly.
